--  "Egana et al. (2006) reported that oxygen kinetics decreased in pedaling exercise in the supine position than in the upright position, while the oxygen kinetics did not differ between the recumbent and upright positions in a different study (Egana et al., 2010). "

Therefore endurance in a recumbant should be equivalent to an upright cycle. However, the muscle strength is reduced by having a rotated hip angle. 
"Isokinetic maximal peak torque measured in this study during pedaling showed higher values in the supine position than in the recumbent position at all angular velocities."
Increase muscle mass to account for this.
